In this paper, we proposed several optimization strategies that can be applied to the LARS algorithm and give a summary on their performance.
Besides optimization that can also be done by the compilers, we also proposed specific optimization according to its mathematical implication and data access pattern.
We achieved an overall $7.2\times$ speed-up, reaching 4.10 flops/cycle, in performance against the baseline implementation without optimization flags (0.57 flops/cycle) and a $2.0\times$ speed-up from a compiler optimized version (2.12 flops/cycle).






% Here you need to briefly summarize what you did and why this is

% is a very different situation from the abstract. Try to highlight
% important results and say the things you really want to get across
% (e.g., the results show that we are within 2x of the optimal performance ...

% steps if you want. Be brief.
